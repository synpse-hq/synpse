# Home Assistant on Synpse

[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) is a popular open-source home automation tool. 

It can either be installed as a "Home Assistant Operating System" that strictly limits what else you can do with your device or you can choose to install it as a [container](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/linux#install-home-assistant-container) through Docker.

## Deployment

Use `ha-synpse.yaml` to deploy a containerized version of Home Assistant. Once deployed, you can access it using `http://<device IP>:8123`. Next steps can be found in [Home Assistant official docs](https://www.home-assistant.io/getting-started/onboarding/).
